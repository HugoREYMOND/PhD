	abstract = {As gas atomisation has been the main method for producing high-performance spherical powders in the past decades, its application in the production of metallic powders has become one of the main research subjects in this ﬁeld. Since it is challenging to directly observe the atomising gas and to investigate melt ﬂow states by experiments, numerical simulation is attracting increasing interest in studying the gas atomisation process. In this work, various computational ﬂuid dynamics models were implemented to simulate the gas atomisation process. With the models, the droplet breakup, cooling, and solidiﬁcation within the coupled process were investigated. The ﬁnal mean particle size was predicted through numerical simulations and compared with the statistics extracted from the gas atomisation process, which shows that a reasonable mass median diameter of the particle can be predicted numerically. The results also show a clear relationship between the breakup trajectory and the resulting particle size.},

	abstract = {Based on the preparation of TC4 powder under electrode induction melting gas atomization in this study, the concept of pre-breakup in the free-fall nozzle channel is innovatively proposed. The computational fluid dynamics method was used to simulate the pre-breakup process, and the effect of initial droplet size on the pre-breakup process was investigated. The pre-breakup process of TC4 discontinuous droplets was simulated using a Eulerian-Eulerian volume of fluid multiphase model and the Reynolds stress model. In addition, the Eulerian-Lagrangian discrete phase model and the unstable breakup model were employed to simulate the entire atomization process of the discontinuous droplets and predict the size of the powder particles. Some simulation results were verified based on experimental measurements. The results exhibit that the pre-breakup process of discontinuous droplets can be mainly divided into the formation of ellipsoidal droplets, the formation of annular disk-shaped stacked droplets, the formation of disk-shaped liquid films, and the breakage of the disk-shaped liquid film. In addition, the pre-breakup of small droplets or droplets with appropriately increased size can effectively prevent the broken droplets from hitting and adhering to the inner wall surface of the nozzle channel. Finally, with the increase of initial droplet size, the atomized powder particle size becomes gradually coarse, and the powder particle size distribution becomes gradually concentrated.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.mtcomm.2020.101423},
	abstract = {Cooling rate of metal/alloy droplet is the core factor that influences formation of amorphous powder. The close-coupled gas atomization becomes a feasible way to prepare amorphous powder since it can get high cooling rate of atomized droplets. Therefore, a numerical simulation method for calculating the cooling process of Al droplets in atomizing gas was set up to disclose the basic cooling law of atomized droplets in powder preparation based on close-coupled gas atomization as well as the major influencing factors. Numerical simulation on relevant experiments was carried out. The numerical simulation results of droplet cooling rate are in high accordance with experimental results. On this basis, influences of several key parameters (e.g. droplet diameter (d), relative gas velocity (v) and type of atomizing gases) on droplet cooling rate were analyzed. According to numerical simulation results, nitrogen (N2) was used as the atomizing gas, and v =200 m/s, the cooling rate of droplets with diameters of 15 μm, 25 μm, 50 μm, 100 μm and 150 μm in gas flow field is 10⁴-10⁶K/s and the cooling rate increases by 85.98 \%, 192.47 \%, 198.48 \% and 124.63 \% with the reduction of droplet diameter, indicating a significant growth of cooling rate of droplets. Given d =100 μm and N2 as the atomizing gas, cooling rate of droplets in an gas flow field values 10⁴-10⁵K/s under different gas velocities of v =50 m/s, 100 m/s, 150 m/s, 200 m/s and 300 m/s, and with the increase of relative gas velocity, cooling rates are increased by 34.01 \%, 19.86 \%, 14.12 \% and 21.04 \%, indicating the limited growth of cooling rate of droplets. When d =100 μm and v =100 m/s, the cooling rates of droplets in the gas flow fields range within 10⁴-10⁵K/s with changes of atomizing gas among argon (Ar), Air, N2 and helium (He). Moreover, the cooling rates are increased by 35.34 \%, 7.93 \% and 129.15 \% with the increase of thermal conductivity of atomizing gas, indicating an obvious growth of cooling rate of droplets. This study can provide references for studying the formation of amorphous powder through cooling of metal/alloy droplets.},
